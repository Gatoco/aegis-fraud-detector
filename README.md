## Overview

Aegis is a production-ready fraud detection system designed to handle the complex challenges of financial transaction analysis. Built with scalability and interpretability in mind, it addresses the critical business need of identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives that impact customer experience.

**Key Technical Challenges Addressed:**
- Extreme class imbalance (typically <1% fraud rate)
- High-dimensional feature spaces with mixed data types
- Real-time inference requirements with sub-100ms latency
- Regulatory compliance requiring model interpretability
- Concept drift in fraud patterns over time

**Performance Target:** AUC-ROC ≥ 0.87 on IEEE-CIS benchmark dataset
